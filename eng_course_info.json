Emphasis is on the human factors and usability methods, and techniques that can and should be applied throughout the iterative design process. While design issues pertaining to human-computer interaction are discussed, the methods presented can be applied to the design of almost any user interface. Major topics include user research methods for usability and user experience, inspection methods, user testing, applied statistical analysis.",
